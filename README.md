This is supplementary material for a pilot study on the German "am"-progressive.
It consists of a corpus study and an experimental study, both conducted in a "quick and dirty" way and in want of much improvement in future follow-up studies.

The folder "decow" contains the corpus study:
- decow_16_test_amprog.csv contains the results of a corpus query using the test version of DECOW16AX via NoSketchEngine. See R script for the query pattern. Only strings in which forms of "sein" 'to be' are immediately followed by "am" and a (nominalized) verb are considered.
- decow_16_test_amprog_cleft.csv contains the results of a corpus query using the test version of DECOW16AX via NoSketchEngine. See R script for the query pattern. This sheet contains attestations in which forms of "sein" 'to be' are followed by "am" and a (nominalized) verb with a distance of 1-7 tokens.
- "analysis.R" contains the analysis.


The folder "exp" contains the experimental results:
- "acceptability.csv" contains acceptability ratings (one row per stimulus sentence, one column per participant)
- "duration.csv" contains duration estimates (one row per stimulus sentence, one column per participant)
- "analysis.R" contains the analysis.
